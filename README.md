# VisionProfile
  &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;After preparing for research proposal in 2022, I found out that many papers only offer PyTorch models for reference. Meanwhile, me myself also sufferred from version control issues of tensorflow. So I defect to the enemy, PyTorch. </br>
  &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Since this transformation is a tough job, I plan to achieve something simultaneously. Why not replicate the previous learning path in computer vision area. This profile records efferts that I did during this transformation, and part of the painful past exploring deep learning self-motivatedly. Thanks for not helping USTB. </br>
